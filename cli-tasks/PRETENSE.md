This kinda outlines the purpose of the TaskCLI project, its practical use cases, and the key Go programming principles and techniques learned during its development.

## Glossary
- **CLI**: Command Line Interface
- **TUI**: Text User Interface
- **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **ORM**: Object-Relational Mapping
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation
- **YAML**: YAML Ain't Markup Language
- **Cobra**: A CLI framework for Go
- **Viper**: A configuration management library for Go
- **Bubble Tea**: A TUI framework for Go
- **CI**: Continuous Integration
- **CD**: Continuous Deployment

## 1. Purpose

TaskCLI (cli-tasks) is a terminal-based to-do list manager written in Go. It was created as:
- A hands-on learning project to practice Goâ€™s core features and ecosystem tools.
- A reusable utility for quickly tracking tasks without leaving the command line.
- A demonstration of how to build and structure a real-world CLI app in Go.

## 2. Practical Use Cases

1. Daily Task Tracking

2. Date-Scoped Task Review

3. Priority-Based Scheduling

4. Deadline Management

5. Quick State Changes

6. Batch or Scripted Operations

## 3. Go Programming Principles & Learning

1. **Project Structure & Modules** (main package serving as the application entry point + Go modules (go.mod) for dependency management)

2. **Data Modeling & JSON Persistence** (Struct definitions (Task struct) with JSON tags + Encoding/Decoding using encoding/json for file-based data storage + Atomic file writes via temporary files and os.Rename to ensure data integrity)

3. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** (Cobra for subcommand parsing, flag handling, and autogenerated help text + Viper for configuration file support (e.g., ~/.taskcli.yaml))

4. **Go Standard Library Mastery** (File I/O: ioutil.ReadFile, ioutil.WriteFile, os.Stat for file existence checks + Error Handling: Idiomatic if err != nil patterns and os.Exit for recoverable vs fatal errors + String Manipulation: strings.Join to construct task titles from CLI args)

5. **Code Organization & Extensibility** (Load-Mutate-Save pattern for all CRUD operations on tasks)

6. **Interactive & UI Elements (Bonus)** (Terminal animations with simple loops and fmt.Printf for user feedback)

### Hypothetical "Next Steps"
- Integrate search and tag filters.
- Add undo functionality via in-memory action history.
- Experiment with a TUI using Bubble Tea.
- Add automated tests and CI integration.
